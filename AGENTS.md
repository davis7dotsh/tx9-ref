Use bun over node in this project.

When you finish making a change, run `bun run format` and `bun run check`

When styling pages, use tailwindcss and use a neutral color palette. Tailwind true neutral colors (i.e. `text-neutral-500`), no blueish or greenish colors. For accents, use the primary color defined in the layout css file.

When installing a new package, use `bun add` to install it, don't just edit package.json manually.
